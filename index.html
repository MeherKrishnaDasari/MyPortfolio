<legend>About Me</legend>
<p>Hello! I’m Meher, a curious mind fueled by a passion for problem-solving and Python development. Ever since I started coding, I’ve been fascinated by how simple logic can evolve into powerful solutions. Whether it’s writing clean, efficient code or automating tedious tasks, I love crafting tools that make life easier.</p>
<p>From mastering algorithms to developing web scraping applications, I thrive on turning ideas into functional, real-world projects. My journey has led me to explore data handling, web technologies, and automation, pushing me to think critically and adapt dynamically.</p>
<p>Beyond coding, I’m always eager to learn new technologies, refine my skills, and take on challenges that expand my creativity. When I’m not immersed in solving technical puzzles, I enjoy exploring new ways to make code more efficient and building projects that showcase the beauty of logic and innovation.</p>

<li><b>Emergency Vehicle Priority Traffic Signal System</b></li>
    <p>Python | Tkinter | Multithreading | Event-Driven Programming
•	Engineered a real-time traffic signal simulation system handling multiple intersections and directions with precise, thread-safe control of traffic light cycles.
•	Developed an emergency vehicle priority mechanism that dynamically overrides normal traffic signals to ensure rapid passage for emergency vehicles.
•	Designed and implemented an intuitive GUI dashboard with Tkinter, providing live visual updates on signal states and enabling manual emergency triggers.
•	Applied advanced concurrency techniques to manage simultaneous signal operations and emergency event handling seamlessly.
•	Created modular, scalable code architecture to facilitate future integration with AI-powered emergency vehicle detection and smart city infrastructure.

<li><b>WEB SCRAPING USING PYTHON</b></li>
<p> Python | BeautifulSoup | Requests | Pandas | Data Automation

Created a Python tool to automatically collect data from websites like job portals, e-commerce platforms, and news sites.

Used Requests and BeautifulSoup to pull and parse web content, targeting specific information like product names, prices, or job listings.

Organized the scraped data with Pandas, making it clean, structured, and ready for use in reports or dashboards.

Handled challenges like multi-page navigation, slow-loading sites, and anti-bot protections using smart headers, retries, and session handling.

Made the code modular and reusable, so it’s easy to adapt for scraping different sites or new types of data in the future.

<li><b>My Portfolio Project</b></li>
<p>This portfolio serves as a digital showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey. Designed with a focus on responsiveness and user experience, it provides an interactive space for potential employers and collaborators to explore my work.</p>
<p>Technologies used:HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT<p>
<li><b>LIBRARy MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</b></li>
<p>A Library Management System (LMS) is designed to streamline the organization, management, and tracking of books in a library. It automates various operations such as book issuance, returns, cataloging, user management, and fine calculation. This system improves efficiency, reduces manual errors, and enhances accessibility for both library staff and users
</p>
<p>Python | SQLite | Tkinter | OOP Concepts
Built using Python with a Tkinter-based GUI to make the interface user-friendly for librarians and admins.

Implemented core features like adding/updating books, registering members, issuing and returning books, and tracking due dates.

Used SQLite as the backend database to store all book, member, and transaction records reliably.

Applied object-oriented programming to organize the system into manageable, reusable components.

Focused on clean architecture and future scalability, making it easy to extend with features like fine calculation or barcode integration.</p>

<h4>OPTIMISING WEB SCRAPING BY PYTHON</h4>
<fieldset>
<legend>Technical Blog</legend>
<p>By Meher Krishna Dasari<br>
Introduction<br>
Web scraping is an essential technique for extracting valuable data from websites. As a developer working with Python, I've encountered various challenges and optimizations that can make or break a scraping project. In this blog, I'll walk through some best practices, common pitfalls, and real-world insights based on my experience.</br>

Why Web Scraping?<br>
Every day, data plays a crucial role in decision-making. Whether it's market analysis, price comparison, or content aggregation, scraping empowers us to collect structured data efficiently. However, scraping must be done ethically while respecting website policies.

Setting Up the Right Tools</br>
Before diving into coding, here are essential Python libraries for web scraping:</br>
- Requests – Handles HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.<br>
- BeautifulSoup – Parses HTML and extracts specific elements.<br>
- Selenium – Automates browser actions for dynamic sites.<br>
- pandas – Organizes scraped data for further processing.<br>

To install them use:<br>
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas <br>
